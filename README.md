# Youtube-Transcript-Summeriser
First of all, let’s discuss what is summarization. Summarization is the technique of making short, understandable notes for a given large text document without excluding the important contents of the passage. There are 2 types of summarization in NLP, extractive summarization and abstractive summarization.
Have you ever imagined getting a short summary of a big youtube tutorial or video for quick reading before watching the video, definitely this will help you to save a lot of your time by getting a quick understanding or summarization about the video in a short time. In this article, we are discussing a mini NLP project, a YouTube Summarizer which will summarize the content(subtitle) of the youtube video. For many videos, the main content of the videos is only 50-60% of the total length, so our youtube summarizer will summarize the content of the video by keeping all the important points and making it short and easily understandable. This will be useful in getting the summary of several lecture videos easily.
